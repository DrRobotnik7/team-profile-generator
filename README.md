## Usage

URL: https://drrobotnik7.github.io/random-password-generator/

- Click on the "Generate Password" button. 
- Select a password length from between 8 and 128 characters. Choosing a number out of that range, or not using a number at all, will cause the prompt to just repeat until a valid option is chosen.
- Click "OK" on the character types you would like included in your password. You can choose from special characters, numbers, lowercase letters and uppercase letter, in that order.
- If you don't choose any of the first 3 options, you will automatically have an all uppercase password generated for you.
